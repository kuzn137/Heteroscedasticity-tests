# Heteroscedasticity-tests, Park and Glejser methods

# Description
 Class for Heteroscedasticity tests, Park and Glejser methods.  Both methods use linear regression for original incoming feature or its function and a function of residuals as outcome. Park test uses linear regression for log(|x|), x is incoming feature in original regression, and log(residuals^2).
 Glejser test chooses between three linear regressions for absolute value of residuals outcome and |x| (test #1), sqrt(|x|) (test #2) and 1/|x| (test #3) as incoming features by best R2 score.
 Heteroscedasticity is tested by p value for resulting regression (if p value < 0.005 for Park and p value < 0.00001, we have heteroscedasticity). From tests with different datasets it was established what P values are good. The threshold Pvalues are approximate value. Tests limitation is that it is assumed that resulting regression with residuals does not have Heteroscedasticity. If one method has high p value it is good to consider all methods.
