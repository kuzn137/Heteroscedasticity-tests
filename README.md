# Heteroscedasticity-tests, Park and Glejser methods

# Description
 Class for Heteroscedasticity tests, Park and Glejser methods.  Both methods use linear regression for original incoming feature or its function and a function of residuals as outcome. Park test uses linear regression for log(abs(x)), x is incoming feature in original regression, and log(residuals^2).
 Glejser test chooses between three linear regressions for absolute value of residuals outcome and absolute value of x, sqrt(abs(x)) and 1/x as incoming features by best R2 score.
 Heteroscedasticity is tested by p value for resulting regression (if p value < 0.05, we have heteroscedasticity). Tests limitation is that it is assumed that resulting regression with residuals does not have Heteroscedasticity. If one method has high p value it is good to consider all methods.
