# Heteroscedasticity-tests

# Description
 Class for Heteroscedasticity tests, Park and Glejser methods.  Both methods use linear regression for original incoming feature function and a function of residuals as outcome.
 Park test uses linear regression for log(x), x is incoming feature in original regression, and log(residuals^2).
 Glejser test choses between three linear regression for squared residuals outcome and x, sqrt(x) and 1/x as incoming features by best R2 score.
 If there is Heteroscedasticity is tested by p value for resulting regression (if p value < 0.05, we have Heteroscedasticity).
 Tests limitation is that it is assumed that resulting regression does not have Heteroscedasticity. If one method has high p value it is good to consider all methods.
 Class is under construction.
